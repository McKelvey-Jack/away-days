      "Anfield is one of the few football stadiums known the world over by name alone. A traditional four cornered ground with stands close to the pitch and a famous atmosphere, the ground in fact initially played host to Liverpool's bitter local rivals Everton. Having hosted Liverpool FC for nearly 125 years, the Main Stand was redeveloped ahead of the 2016-2017 season and both capacity and facilities were improved as a result.As host to one of England's most successful football teams, Anfield has a large museum and very popular stadium tours. Full hospitality is available on matchdays with corporate hosting, private hire and conference facilities at other times. The stadium is worth a visit for anyone visiting the city of Liverpool, not just on matchdays.Anfield is also very close to Goodison Park, home to Everton FC, with a walk of just over half a mile required through Stanley Park to get there.",

It’s also known as The Amex for simplicity reasons! It’s located near to the village of Falmer, which is where it got its original name from. The Amex replaced the club’s former stadium, the Goldstone Ground, owing to the fact that the club’s former owners sold it to developers. Because the old owners didn’t line- up a replacement ground for Brighton they ended up bouncing around a number of different stadiums whilst they looked for their own home.Originally they ground - shared with Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium before using Withdean Stadium for a time.The location that would eventually be the building area for Falmer Stadium was actually identified as early as 1998. However delays in planning permission meant that Brighton had to wait over a decade until their new stadium was officially opened in 2011.",

The ground has its own claim to fame in a more modern sense, too, as it was the first to host a floodlit football match, which it did on the 14th of October 1878. The uniqueness of Bramall Lane doesn’t stop there.It is one of only two stadiums in the world that has hosted an England football international match, an England cricket test match and an FA Cup Final.England’s national side played five internationals at the Sheffield ground before 1930, whilst the cricket test match came in 1902 when England played Australia.The FA Cup final was actually a replay between Barnsley and West Brom, a match that Barnsley won 1-0.",

In 2019 they moved into their current home of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, built on the same site as White Hart Lane. As for Spurs themselves they have numerous claims to fame.They are the only non- league team to ever win the FA Cup, for example, something that they achieved in 1901, 19 years after the team had been formed.They were also the first team in the 20th century to win a league and FA Cup double, which they did in 1960 - 1961. In 2017 the club made the decision to demolish White Hart Lane in order to build a new stadium on top of it, which opened in 2019 under the imaginative name of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",

      "When West Ham United made the decision to leave Upton Park, their home ground for 112 years, it seemed as though someone also made the decision to start calling it the Boleyn Ground. No one is sure as to why, but there you go. The Hammers departure from a stadium that had opened its doors for the first time back in 1904 was seen as risky but necessary. By that point it was showing its age and the cost of updating it sufficiently was prohibitive. Thankfully there was a state-of-the-art stadium needing new occupants, so West Ham's owners did their best to make sure that they were the ones that moved in. There was a not insignificant amount of controversy surrounding West Ham's bidding for the use of The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but that's a tale for another time. As the name above might suggest, the ground was built as the main venue for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games hosted by London.It was where the track and field events were held, as well as both the opening and closing ceremonies, the former being famously directed by Danny Boyle.Renovations to the stadium took place between 2013 and 2016 in order to prepare it for use by West Ham, as well as for British Athletics to use when the Hammers aren't playing football. Despite rarely selling out games, West Ham were able to sell all 50,000 of their season tickets in the 57,000 seater ground ahead of the 2016-2017 Premier League season.",
