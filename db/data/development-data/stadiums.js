      "Although it operates since 1884, the first tenant was not LFC, but Everton. But since the club could not buy the ground from its owner, they moved to Goodison Park. The move left John Orrell with an empty stadium so he launched Liverpool FC. The club started playing in 1892 and by 1906 already had 2 championships on their account. During that time three new stands were raised. In 1928 history of the world's most famous stand began, as The Kop was expanded to accomodate 30,000 standing fans. For decades this has been the central point for Liverpool FC fanbase. Further redevelopments allowed the club to achieve a record audience of over 61,000 in 1952 and play their first game with floodlights in 1957. Crucial changes came in the 90's as a result of Taylor Report, published after Hillsborough disaster. Currently the stadium comemorises 96 victims of that day with an eternal flame. Legendary manager Bill Shankly also has his place at Anfield with a monument and a gate named after him.In 2014-2016 the stadium underwent its largest partial reconstruction to date. The western main stand grew from one to three tiers, dominating the stadium and landscape. Thanks to this change, LFC are able to invite over 50,000 fans for the first time since conversion to all-seating capacity. The club also has outline planning permission for similar expansion to follow along Anfield Road.",

      "The Seagulls” had to leave their Goldstone Ground in 1997, two years after the club sold the ground. They had no alternative venue in Brighton, so were playing 75km away in Gillingham. Though attempts to build a new home stadium started back in the 1990’s, no success came for a decade. Supporters were running several large-scale campaigns that even got the prime minister involved, but for years procedural issues and opposition held the project back.Finally at the end of 2008 construction works started on site and finished in early June 2011. The result was American Express Community Stadium, as it’s called for sponsorship reasons. But since no-one really cares to say the whole name, it’s more often called AmEx Stadium or simply The AmEx. There also are some more traditional supporters who refuse to acknowledge the name, still calling it Falmer Stadium, as was the name during planning and construction.but however they call it, it’s still a 22,347-seater worth Ł105mln. The seats were divided into four separate stands. Main one has three tiers and accommodates over half the capacity – 11,833. Opposite is the family stand (5,404) while behind both goals there are ends for the more vocal locals (north – 2,688 seats) and away fans (2,575).If demand is high, corners may be filled and current stands may also receive a second tier to give a capacity of 35,000. Which proved needed as already during construction it turned out that the planned 2,109 business seats was too little and another 400 were made. By mid-2013 stands had to grow further, reaching 30,750.",

The ground has its own claim to fame in a more modern sense, too, as it was the first to host a floodlit football match, which it did on the 14th of October 1878.The uniqueness of Bramall Lane doesn’t stop there. It is one of only two stadiums in the world that has hosted an England football international match, an England cricket test match and an FA Cup Final. England’s national side played five internationals at the Sheffield ground before 1930, whilst the cricket test match came in 1902 when England played Australia. The FA Cup final was actually a replay between Barnsley and West Brom, a match that Barnsley won 1-0.",

      'The Hawthorns has been the home of West Bromwich Albion since its doors first opened on the third of September 1900. It was the first Football League ground to be built in the 20th Century and its construction took just four months. That isn’t the only first that the Black Country ground lays claim to either, it was also the first stadium to introduce electronic turnstile aggregators!The Midlands club have long prided themselves on not only being a club of tradition but also of moving with the times and they revolutionised the way grounds are accessed once more when they introduced the Stilecard system in 2002. That year also saw them become the first club to have big screens in a widescreen format at their stadium.As for the Baggies themselves, they’ve had a mixed history. They won the First Division championship in 1920, the only time in the club’s history they’ve won the top league, but have spent roughly half of their existence in the second tier of English football. They gained promotion to the Premier League for the 2010-2011 season and have remained in the top flight since.'
