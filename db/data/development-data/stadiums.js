      "Anfield is one of the few football stadiums known the world over by name alone. A traditional four cornered ground with stands close to the pitch and a famous atmosphere, the ground in fact initially played host to Liverpool's bitter local rivals Everton. Having hosted Liverpool FC for nearly 125 years, the Main Stand was redeveloped ahead of the 2016-2017 season and both capacity and facilities were improved as a result.As host to one of England's most successful football teams, Anfield has a large museum and very popular stadium tours. Full hospitality is available on matchdays with corporate hosting, private hire and conference facilities at other times. The stadium is worth a visit for anyone visiting the city of Liverpool, not just on matchdays.Anfield is also very close to Goodison Park, home to Everton FC, with a walk of just over half a mile required through Stanley Park to get there.",

The Amex replaced the club’s former stadium, the Goldstone Ground, owing to the fact that the club’s former owners sold it to developers. Because the old owners didn’t line- up a replacement ground for Brighton they ended up bouncing around a number of different stadiums whilst they looked for their own home.Originally they ground - shared with Gillingham at Priestfield Stadium before using Withdean Stadium for a time.The location that would eventually be the building area for Falmer Stadium was actually identified as early as 1998. However delays in planning permission meant that Brighton had to wait over a decade until their new stadium was officially opened in 2011.",

      "When West Ham United made the decision to leave Upton Park, their home ground for 112 years, it seemed as though someone also made the decision to start calling it the Boleyn Ground. No one is sure as to why, but there you go. The Hammers departure from a stadium that had opened its doors for the first time back in 1904 was seen as risky but necessary. By that point it was showing its age and the cost of updating it sufficiently was prohibitive. Thankfully there was a state-of-the-art stadium needing new occupants, so West Ham's owners did their best to make sure that they were the ones that moved in. There was a not insignificant amount of controversy surrounding West Ham's bidding for the use of The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but that's a tale for another time. As the name above might suggest, the ground was built as the main venue for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games hosted by London.It was where the track and field events were held, as well as both the opening and closing ceremonies, the former being famously directed by Danny Boyle.Renovations to the stadium took place between 2013 and 2016 in order to prepare it for use by West Ham, as well as for British Athletics to use when the Hammers aren't playing football. Despite rarely selling out games, West Ham were able to sell all 50,000 of their season tickets in the 57,000 seater ground ahead of the 2016-2017 Premier League season.",

      "Since the club’s foundation in 1919, Leeds United have only ever played their home fixtures at one ground: Elland Road. The ground began its life as the host of sporting fixtures much earlier than the formation of Leeds United, however. Built in 1897 and opening the same year, it spent seven years as the home of Holbeck Rugby Club and was originally called The Old Peacock Ground, named after the pub that stood opposite to it. Leeds United also weren’t the first football team to play games on the Elland Road pitch. Leeds City Football Club was the leading professional club in the city from 1904 until it dissolved due to financial difficulties in 1919, with United taking over from them as the city’s foremost side. The players of Leeds City were then auctioned off at the city’s Metropole Hotel though, interestingly, none of the players ever player for Leeds United.",

      'The Hawthorns has been the home of West Bromwich Albion since its doors first opened on the third of September 1900. It was the first Football League ground to be built in the 20th Century and its construction took just four months. That isn’t the only first that the Black Country ground lays claim to either, it was also the first stadium to introduce electronic turnstile aggregators!The Midlands club have long prided themselves on not only being a club of tradition but also of moving with the times and they revolutionised the way grounds are accessed once more when they introduced the Stilecard system in 2002. That year also saw them become the first club to have big screens in a widescreen format at their stadium.As for the Baggies themselves, they’ve had a mixed history. They won the First Division championship in 1920, the only time in the club’s history they’ve won the top league, but have spent roughly half of their existence in the second tier of English football. They gained promotion to the Premier League for the 2010-2011 season and have remained in the top flight since.'
